# ♻️ Waste Classification using CNN  

## 📌 Introduction  
Waste management is a growing concern worldwide. Recycling and proper segregation of waste are crucial for reducing pollution and conserving resources. This project applies **Deep Learning** techniques to classify waste images into two categories:  
- **Organic**  
- **Recyclable**  

The classification is performed using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** implemented in Python.
